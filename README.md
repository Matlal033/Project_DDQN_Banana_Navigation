# Project DDQN Banana Navigation
 
### Project Details

This is the first project of the Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning nanodegree.
For this particular instance, a DDQN is used to solve the Banana Navigation problem from the Unity environment.

The state space has a size of 37, and the action space a size of 4 (front, back, left, right).
Yellow bananas are worth 1 point, and blue ones are worth -1 point.
The environment is considered solved when the average score over 100 consecutive episodes reaches 13.0.

### Getting started
